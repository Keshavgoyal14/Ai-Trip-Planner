# TRIPMATE(AI Trip Planner)

TripMate is a smart and intuitive AI-powered travel planning web application that helps users create personalized, day-wise itineraries based on their travel preferences. Built using Gemini AI, Firebase, and Google Authentication, the app allows users to input details such as destination, travel duration, interests, and budget through a user-friendly form. In response, the AI generates an optimized travel plan tailored to the user's needs. With real-time data syncing, saved trip history, and additional features like PDF export and map integration, TripMate simplifies the entire travel planning experience into just a few clicks. To support unlimited trip generation and advanced features, TripMate also integrates Razorpay for secure one-time payments. Users on the free tier can generate up to three itineraries, after which they can upgrade seamlessly through Razorpay, unlocking premium access with instant activation and persistent account status stored in Firebase.
